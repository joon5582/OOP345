1. As we encode each charactor with Key value by using ^(XOR) operator, The encoded results can be non-ascii code char.
And that can't be properly displayed as text file. That's why we use binary format at this time.

2. By binding function to arguments, we simply put the created function pointer into the argument of thread.

3. By using thread library, I used 4 threads to encode single file. This makes it possible to process the encoding at the same time in multi-core cpu.
And this really saves much time compared to non-multiple thread program.
