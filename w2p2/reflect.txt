There is significant time difference between the copy and move operations.
There are many reasons for this. For example,

for (size_t i = 0; i < m_numOfstring; i++)
{
	m_stringArray[i] = other.m_stringArray[i];
}

This for loop is inside of copy assignment function. So it takes O(n) time depends on the size of the array.
But in move operation, the memory address of source array is just taken by destination array. Therefore, it takes O(1) time.
It took a lot of time to understand the contents of the chrono module. However, after understanding, the code was concise and was able to implement the desired function simply.
